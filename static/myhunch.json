Loosely based on the early years of Elizabeth's reign, in 2007, Blanchett reprised the role in the sequel, Elizabeth: The Golden Age, covering the later part of her reign.  The film brought Australian actress Blanchett to international attention. She won several awards for her portrayal of Elizabeth, notably a BAFTA and a Golden Globe in 1998, while the film was also named the 1998 BAFTA Best British Film. Nominated in 7 categories in the 71st Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actress, it won the Academy Award for Best Makeup.  The film sees a young Elizabeth elevated to the throne on the death of her half-sister Mary I, who had imprisoned her. Her reign over the divided and bankrupt realm is perceived as weak and under threat of invasion by Early Modern France or Habsburg Spain. For the future stability and security of the crown she is urged by advisor William Cecil (Attenborough) to marry, and has suitors in the Catholic Philip II of Spain and the French Henri, Duc d'Anjou. She instead embarks on an affair with the wholly unsuitable Robert Dudley (Fiennes).","score":[0,0,4.774066110635936,false,0.9435165276589841],"image_url":"http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/b/hn/2687023/2456030471764493746","urls":["http://hunch.com/item/hn_2687023/elizabeth/","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_(film)","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KOw9WPgays","http://www.amazon.com/Elizabeth-The-Golden-Age/dp/B0011MRKHW","http://www.amazon.com/Elizabeth-The-Golden-Age/dp/B0015F1VY8","http://www.amazon.com/Elizabeth/dp/B0026IUXO2","http://www.amazon.com/Elizabeth/dp/B0026IQYEA","http://www.facebook.com/pages/Elizabeth/103135706393686","http://www.facebook.com/pages/Elizabeth/112654792082367","http://www.flixster.com/movie/elizabeth/","http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1084153-elizabeth/","http://www.freebase.com/view/m/011yr9","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127536/","http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/elizabeth/id296596971","http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/4518","http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Elizabeth/17236680"],"directed_by":"Shekhar Kapur","release_year":1998,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":124,"result_id":"hn_2687023","trailer":"http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi4037280025/","rt_critics_rating":"Certified Fresh"},{"average_ratings":{"rt":98,"imdb":8.2,"hn":3.558139534883721,"flixter":0.89},"mpaa_ratings":["PG-13"],"rating_counts":{"hn":43,"flixter":28234},"rating":8.2,"description":"After Raymond returns from the Korean War as a decorated hero, the other members of his platoon can't really remember what he did to win his medal.

Bundled in dark overcoats, they watch over the city with ears open to the heartbeat of the human soul, listening to the internal musings and yearnings of earthbound humans like existential detectives. In these delicate, astounding scenes we float through the thoughts of dozens Berlin citizens, from the weary and worn to the hopeful and young, as the angels record the magic moments for some heavenly record. But when Damiel (the empathic and sensitive Bruno Ganz) falls in love with an angel of another sort, the lonely trapeze artist Marion (willowy, sad-eyed Solveig Dommartin), he gives up the contemplation and observation of life to experience it himself.   Wim Wenders's most purely romantic film is like poetry on celluloid, a celebration of the transient and fragile moments of being human: the warmth of a cup of coffee on a cold day, the embrace of a friend, the touch of a lover, the rapture of love. Opening with an angel's-eye view of Berlin in silvery black and white (delicately captured by the great cinematographer Henri Alekan, who photographed Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast 40 years earlier), it transforms into a gauzy color world when Damiel \"crosses over\" by sheer will.

Splendidly adapted from the novel by E.M. Forster, it's a comedy of the heart, a passionate romance and a study of repression within the British class system of manners and mores. It's that system of rigid behavior that prevents young Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) from accepting the loving advances of a free-spirited suitor (Julian Sands), who fears that she will follow through with her engagement to a priggish intellectual (Daniel Day-Lewis) whose capacity for passion is virtually nonexistent. During and after a trip to Italy with her protective companion (Maggie Smith), Lucy gradually gets in touch with her true emotions. The fun of watching A Room with a View comes from seeing how Lucy's thoughts and feelings finally arrive at the same romantic conclusion. Through an abundance of humor both subtle and overt, this crowd-pleasing \"art movie\" rose to an unexpected level of popular appeal. The Merchant-Ivory team received eight Academy Award nominations for their efforts, and won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, Art Direction, and Costume Design. --Jeff Shannon","tags":["romantic","movie","romance","drama","independent","award winning","online video","1980s","netflix streaming","rated g","romantic comedies","made money","dramatic movie","romantic films","romance movies","romcoms"],"price":13.93,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/K/M/Z/KMZ-3717373.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/a/-/r/a-room-with-a-view-7394264.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0091867/87168238eb41cf5f1fbe24df83af897d4fc0cdd2","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/367806015/d4263dafe56bf5014ca8c04b3560cf85ac4a53c3","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/60035684/ae4463b2d901c181c0f0a18f6f500c0751c9536f"],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_romantic-movie":"Romance","list_movie":"Movie","list_netflix-watch-instantly":"Netflix Streaming","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"release_year":1986,"name":"A Room with a View","language":"English","is_saved":false,"url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_2313083/a-room-with-a-view/","release_date":"1986-04-11","popularity":0,"birthdate":"1985-12-01","synopsis":"When Lucy Honeychurch and chaperone Charlotte Bartlett find themselves in Florence with rooms without views, fellow guests Mr Emerson and son George step in to remedy the situation.

Not that there aren't moments of intense violence, but No Country for Old Men is their quietest, most existential film yet. In this modern-day Western, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a Vietnam vet who could use a break. One morning while hunting antelope, he spies several trucks surrounded by dead bodies (both human and canine). In examining the site, he finds a case filled with $2 million. Moss takes it with him, tells his wife (Kelly Macdonald) he's going away for awhile, and hits the road until he can determine his next move. On the way from El Paso to Mexico, he discovers he's being followed by ex-special ops agent Chigurh (an eerily calm Javier Bardem). Chigurh's weapon of choice is a cattle gun, and he uses it on everyone who gets in his way--or loses a coin toss (as far as he's concerned, bad luck is grounds for death). Just as Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a World War II vet, is on Moss's trail, Chigurh's former colleague, Wells (Woody Harrelson), is on his. For most of the movie, Moss remains one step ahead of his nemesis. Both men are clever and resourceful--except Moss has a conscience, Chigurh does not (he is, as McCarthy puts it, \"a prophet of destruction\"). At times, the film plays like an old horror movie, with Chigurh as its lumbering Frankenstein monster. Like the taciturn terminator, No Country for Old Men doesn't move quickly, but the ten ...","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_movies-tv","list_amazon-instant-movie","list_dramatic-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie","list_thriller-movie"],"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/n/o/-/no-country-for-old-men-2896103.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/amz/B003V5K0HY/ebc2dc2b3dc73be2d64bbfe92ea2a0d301bb7da0","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0477348/26c9eca81ecedbb7697646e8fd88f72e1923412f","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/432467787/6255777fafe3ddd766cc525f765ce81efed1a125"],"years":"2007","stars":4.740909668939004,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_movie":"Movie","list_thriller-movie":"Thrillers","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B003V5K0HY","fb_107783479242809","fb_109369595747822","fb_109403232418642","fb_112743472074783","fb_20172897360","fb_23751273824","flixter_m770669872","freebase_0b6tzs","hn_3580564","imdb_tt0477348","itunes_432467787","moviedb_6977","netflix_70071613","rt_770669872"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"name":"No Country for Old Men","language":"English, Spanish","title":"No Country for Old Men","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3580564/no-country-for-old-men/","release_date":"2007-11-21","tags":["movie","drama","crime","r","thriller","director","2000s","coen brothers","ethan coen","oscar winner","crime movie","recent","major studio release","adapted by the coen bros","mystery movie","thriller movie","dramatic movie","thriller film"],"birthdate":"2007-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"Bolstered by powerful lead performances from Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones, No Country for Old Men finds the Coen brothers spinning cinematic gold out of Cormac McCarthy's grim, darkly funny novel.","synopsis":"In rural Texas, welder and hunter Llewelyn Moss discovers the remains of several drug runners who have all killed each other in an exchange gone violently wrong. Rather than report the discovery to the police, Moss decides to simply take the two million dollars present for himself. This puts the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh, on his trail as he dispassionately murders nearly every rival, bystander and even employer in his pursuit of his quarry and the money.

Besieged by people eager to work with him, however, he also struggles  to find his next idea for a film. The combined pressures draw him within  himself, where his recollections of significant events in his life and the many lovers he has left behind begin to haunt him. The marriage of Fellini's  hyperreal imagery, dreamy sidebars, and the gravity of Guido's increasing guilt  and self-awareness make this as much a deeply moving, soulful film as it is  an electrifying spectacle.","tags":["romantic","movie","romance","drama","fantasy","subtitles","art house","kid-friendly","parenting","family films","fantasy movie","angsty","kids movies","childrens movies","fantasy films","romantic comedies","popular actors","up-beat","winner best foreign language","dramatic movie","romantic films","romance movies","romcoms","kid-safe movies"],"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/D/k/j/Dkj-9190634.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/V/f/a/Vfa-4749323.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/8/-/1/8-1-2-4749804.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/422/b59b780efe665f93cdff04561023d9b36ff7895b","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/rt/18384/e7457d0249a394afe731ffdbb765665873d8887c"],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_family-movie":"Family","list_romantic-movie":"Romance","list_movie":"Movie"},"release_year":1963,"name":"8 1/2","language":"English","is_saved":false,"url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3576684/8-1-2/","release_date":"1963-06-25","popularity":0,"birthdate":"1963-01-01","synopsis":"Dog-tired movie director Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni) retreats to thoughts of yesteryear when his producers, his wife (Anouk Aimee) and his mistress (Sandra Milo) all pressure him to start making another movie.

By intercutting narration from the climbers themselves with a nail-biting reconstruction of their remarkable adventure in the Peruvian Andes, the film has the best of both genres: the authentic stamp of factual storytelling and the edge-of-the-seat tension of a dramatic movie.   In 1985, two British mountaineers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, embarked on a daring--arguably reckless in the extreme--attempt to climb the previously unconquered mountain Siula Grande. A mixture of overconfidence in their own abilities and underestimation of the climb's difficulties brought them to grief after the successful slog to the summit. What follows is an often harrowing account of their perilous descent.   Based on Joe Simpson's gripping book, the film boasts glorious widescreen photography of Siula Grande and its notorious glacier. Actors take the place of the two climbers for close-ups, though Simpson did return to Peru in order to reenact parts of his dreadful crawl back down the ice. The story of Simpson's almost-superhuman fortitude has become legendary in climbing circles, and even for viewers uninterested in mountaineering, Touching the Void is an astonishing slice of real-life drama, magnificently retold. --Mark Walker","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_featured","cat_movies-tv","list_amazon-instant-movie","list_documentary","list_dramatic-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie","list_netflix-watch-instantly","list_sports-movie"],"price":14.99,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/9/a/M/9aM-4661423.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/amz/B004EC6HJI/d6f61f03a16ceabfbbe995e6b58548817ace5243","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/279213003/deb4188ff38a952e4000c1fc6253490b4f25f300","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/11194/713b338f7c532350c27d3ba8cebb8be371932d89","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/60033287/f68a0b0e5b5c56509b251505398dfd5d9906baa1"],"years":"2003","stars":4.716799752183206,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_sports-movie":"Sports","list_netflix-watch-instantly":"Netflix Streaming","list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_documentary":"Documentaries","list_movie":"Movie","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B004EC6HJI","fb_107726452590699","fb_28521248686","flixter_m180886728","freebase_02r04s1","hn_2893783","imdb_tt0379557","itunes_279213003","moviedb_11194","netflix_60033287","rt_180886728"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Documentary","Adventure","Drama","Sport"],"name":"Touching The Void","language":"English","title":"Touching The Void","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_2893783/touching-the-void/","release_date":"2003-12-12","tags":["movie","nature","drama","documentary","r","online video","documentary film","biography","kevin macdonald","netflix streaming","neutral tone","non-controversial","made a lot of money","quirky profiles","dramatic movie","sports","sports movie"],"birthdate":"2003-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"Gripping even though the outcome is known.","synopsis":"The true story of two climbers and their perilous journey up the west face of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes in 1985.

Orpheus, a trolley car conductor and superb samba dancer, is engaged to Mira but in love with Eurydice. For his change of heart, Orpheus and his new doomed lover are pursued by a vengeful Mira and a determined Death through the feverish Carnival night. Camus at once demystifies and remystifies the old story, shifting not only its location but its tone and context, forcing a reevaluation of the legend as a more passionate, pulsing, sensual experience. The film is really one-of-a-kind, an absolute whirl that barely needs words. --Tom Keogh","tags":["comedy","brazilian","romantic","movie","romance","urban","drama","subtitles","humor","science fiction","sci-fi","sad","favela","thrilling","science fiction films","sci-fi movies","romantic comedies","dramatic movie","romantic films","romance movies","romcoms","funny","history","historic","comedic movie","funny movie","historic movie"],"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/U/8/C/U8C-9197494.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/d/I/A/dIA-3585143.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0053146/c30e4d53adcfb839703435a7f9348226488af297","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/40423/e359a7f47c4ca569b51813765d8c8389942052a6","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/rt/10782/143fb62358f3a172f71f390bd6fa22e85eaf7c34"],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_romantic-movie":"Romance","list_comedic-movie":"Comedies","list_science-fiction-movie":"Sci-fi","list_movie":"Movie"},"release_year":1959,"name":"Black Orpheus","language":"English","is_saved":false,"url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3583544/black-orpheus/","release_date":"1959-01-01","popularity":0,"birthdate":"1959-01-01","synopsis":"This superb retelling of the Orpheus and Eurydice Greek legend is set against Rio de Janeiro's madness during Carnival.

And before you roll your eyes at the very thought of another comic covering this well-worn territory, Cummings has found an approach to the material that's unique enough to make her take on it very compelling. She's a foul-mouthed \"guy's girl\" who surrenders none of her femininity in order to be accepted by the male half, and she's just as honest and critical of women as she is of men.

House of Flying Daggers is no exception; if they weren't choreographed with such vigorous imagination, the spectacular action sequences would seem little more than an excuse for vivid hues rippling across the screen. Government officers Leo and Jin (Asian superstars Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro) set out to destroy an underground rebellion called the House of Flying Daggers (named for their weapon of choice, a curved blade that swoops through the air like a boomerang). Their only chance to find the rebels is a blind women named Mei (Ziyi Zhang, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) who has some lethal kung fu moves of her own. In the guise of an aspiring rebel, Jin escorts Mei through gorgeous forests and fields that become bloody battlegrounds as soldiers try to kill them both. While arrows and spears of bamboo fly through the air, Mei, Jin, and Leo turn against each other in surprising ways, driven by passion and honor. Zhang's previous action/art film, Hero, sometimes sacrificed momentum for sheer visual beauty; House of Flying Daggers finds a more muscular balance of aesthetic splendor and dazzling swordplay. --Bret Fetzer","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_movies-tv","list_action-movie","list_dramatic-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie","list_romantic-movie"],"price":6.99,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/amz/B000I8JEWE/67766658c5a7a95c0f65f72f04e89c7941357b18","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/292965574/308fcd08f3883dceb2cc8b0d60c57e6eb3903d20"],"years":"2004","stars":4.693859680428314,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_movie":"Movie","list_action-movie":"Action","list_romantic-movie":"Romance","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B0007Q6VXC","amz_B000I8JEWE","ebay_l370509973416","ebay_p45083148","fb_104154679621930","flixter_m10034","freebase_040b5k","hn_3576654","imdb_tt0385004","itunes_292965574","moviedb_9550","netflix_70012785","rt_10034"],"preferences":[],"genres":"Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy, Romance","name":"House of Flying Daggers","language":"Mandarin","title":"House of Flying Daggers","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3576654/house-of-flying-daggers/","release_date":"2004-12-03","tags":["asian","romantic","movie","romance","drama","fantasy","independent","subtitles","martial arts","action","asia","fantasy movie","pg-13","action movie","fantasy films","romantic comedies","post-1980","strong story","yimou zhang","dramatic movie","romantic films","romance movies","romcoms","independent-unknown"],"birthdate":"2004-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"The visual splendor of the movie makes up for the weak story.","synopsis":"During the reign of the Tang dynasty in China, a secret organization called \"The House of the Flying Daggers\" rises and opposes the government.

The result might resemble Alejandro Amenabar's remarkable second feature, Open Your Eyes, which favors ideas over effects and offers twist upon twist with mind-warping agility. This film rewards multiple viewings, pushing the viewer toward one perception of reality, then switching to another until reality itself is called into question. Melodrama, love story, and psychological thriller combine with a dash of science fiction, forming a plot that is both disorienting and deceptively precise.  Set in Madrid, the story defies description, but this much can be revealed: young, handsome Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) is vain, rich, charming, and--following a botched suicide-murder scheme by a jilted lover--horribly disfigured. He'd fallen in love with Sofia (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) but is now an embittered husk of his former self, stuck in a \"psychiatric penitentiary\" on a murder charge and hiding behind an expressionless mask. His reality has crumbled, but as the film's agenda is gradually revealed, we realize that there are other factors in play. Exposing that agenda would be a criminal offense against those who haven't seen the film; suffice it to say that Open Your Eyes takes you into the twilight zone and beyond, and ...","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_movies-tv","list_dramatic-movie","list_movie","list_mystery-movie","list_romantic-movie","list_science-fiction-movie","list_thriller-movie"],"price":4.49,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/T/x/5/Tx5-4780583.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/amz/B0013T8L26/11a4048a50a0b359dc955723514dec21f878b8c1","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/1902/5c23d3f060b5bcc3d53582c2d97e53a8323f3279"],"years":"1997","stars":4.692647354131633,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_mystery-movie":"Mysteries","list_science-fiction-movie":"Sci-fi","list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_movie":"Movie","list_thriller-movie":"Thrillers","list_romantic-movie":"Romance"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B0013T8L26","fb_103781416327021","flixter_m13332","freebase_032940","hn_2955593","imdb_tt0125659","moviedb_1902","netflix_60021729","rt_13332"],"preferences":[],"genres":"Drama, Mystery, Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller","name":"Open Your Eyes","language":"English","title":"Open Your Eyes","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_2955593/open-your-eyes/","release_date":"1997-12-19","tags":["romantic","movie","romance","drama","fantasy","mystery","science fiction","sci-fi","r","surrealist","thriller","fantasy movie","science fiction films","sci-fi movies","fantasy films","romantic comedies","pre-2000","set in the future","mystery movie","thriller movie","dramatic movie","romantic films","romance movies","romcoms","alejandro amenabar","mystery film","thriller film"],"birthdate":"1997-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"Director Alejandro Amenabar tackles some heady issues with finesse and clarity in Open Your Eyes, a gripping exploration of existentialism and the human spirit.","synopsis":"The handsome and wealthy C\u00e9sar is very successful with women and is having difficulties getting rid of Nuria, his last affair.

Though there's no plot in the usual sense, the movie progresses with growing emotional force from the separation into the bitter fighting between Joan and Bernard and the hapless, floundering behavior of Walt and Frank, who act out through plagiarism, sexual acts, and drinking. Some viewers may find the ending too diffuse; others will appreciate that writer/director Noah Baumbach (Mr. Jealousy) doesn't wrap up the messiness of life in a false cinematic package. Either way, viewers will appreciate how the specificity of the personalities makes The Squid and the Whale so compelling, as Baumbach has drawn the characters with such detail, both engaging and off-putting, that they leap off the screen. Naturally, he's greatly helped by the cast: Linney, Eisenberg, Kline, and especially Daniels bite into these often unsympathetic portraits and give fearlessly honest performances, interlocked in both painful and funny ways--rarely have family dynamics been captured so vividly. If there was an ensemble Oscar, this cast would deserve it. --Bret Fetzer","tags":["comedy","indie","movie","drama","date night","humor","award-winning","r-rated","2000 and later","dramatic movie","funny","comedic movie","funny movie"],"price":2.99,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/amz/B002PNH4R2/5c37ee1e97aa645da67f534c29eac1595990fa73","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/293426773/b951412df90941d7f50c95c9691cc776db28ee64","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/rt/8564/4f2dadaf9f8c52215e55845d3bf071e544a323ed"],"rt_critics_consensus":"This is a piercingly honest, acidly witty look at divorce and its impact on a family.","lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_movie":"Movie","list_comedic-movie":"Comedies","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"release_year":2005,"name":"The Squid and the Whale","language":"English","is_saved":false,"url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_2078993/the-squid-and-the-whale/","release_date":"2006-03-03","popularity":0,"birthdate":"2005-01-01","synopsis":"In 1986, In Brooklyn, New York, the dysfunctional family of pseudo intellectuals composed by the university professor Bernard and the prominent writer Joan split.

The film follows a group of people living in an abandoned section of the New York City underground railway system, more precisely the area of the so called Freedom Tunnel. When he relocated from London to Manhattan, Marc Singer was struck by the number of homeless people he had seen throughout the city. Singer had befriended a good number of New York's homeless and later, after hearing of people living underground in abandoned tunnel systems, he met and became close to a group of people living in The Freedom Tunnel community stretching north from Penn Station past Harlem. After living with them for a number of months, he decided to create a documentary in order to help them financially. The film's crew consisted of the subjects themselves, who rigged up makeshift lighting and steadicam dollies, and learned to use a 16mm camera with black & white Kodak film.","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_featured","cat_movies-tv","list_documentary","list_movie","list_netflix-watch-instantly"],"price":9.75,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/d/a/r/dark-days-4883914.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/14273/a9ecec77744e7d48cec6dd60004db95871fe8900"],"years":"2000","stars":4.684534750269624,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_netflix-watch-instantly":"Netflix Streaming","list_documentary":"Documentaries","list_movie":"Movie"},"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["fb_108164172537939","flixter_m18506","freebase_03xb1g","hn_1833203","imdb_tt0235327","moviedb_14273","netflix_60001871","rt_18506"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Documentary"],"name":"Dark Days","language":"English","title":"Dark Days","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_1833203/dark-days/","release_date":"2000-08-30","tags":["movie","documentary","ur","online video","documentary film","controversial","marc singer","somber","netflix streaming","neutral tone","non-controversial","quirky profiles","media-culture"],"birthdate":"2000-01-01","popularity":0,"synopsis":"A cinematic portrait of the homeless population who live permanently in the underground tunnels of New York City.

upon which it's based, The Kite Runner will haunt the viewer long after the film is over. A tale of childhood betrayal, innocence and harsh reality, and dreamy memory, The Kite Runner faces good and evil--and the path between them, though often blurry and sorrowfully relative. Director Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) presents a painterly vision of Afghanistan before the Soviet tanks, before the Taliban--lush, verdant, fertile--in its landscape and in its people and their history and hopes. The story follows two young boys' friendship, tested beyond endurance, and the haunting of their adult selves by what happened in their youth--and what horrors befall their country in the meantime. The performances of the two boys--Zekeria Ebrahimi (Amir) and Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada (Hassan)--are the film's strongest, unforced and gently evocative. The penance paid by their adult selves is foreshadowed, but never predictable--and the metaphor of innocence lost, a common theme in Forster's work, keeps the film, like the title kites, truly aloft.--A.T.

Significant changes to the source material have been made, but director Niels Arden Opley's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, as it's now called, is mostly riveting. As the story begins, middle-aged investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist) has just been convicted of a bogus charge of libel against a rich and corrupt corporate hotshot when he's unexpectedly offered a most unusual gig. An aging captain of industry named Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) wants Blomkvist to figure out what happened to Vanger's niece, who disappeared more than 40 years earlier; not only is the old man convinced that she was murdered, but he suspects that another member of his large and rather disagreeable family (which includes several former Nazis) is the culprit. Blomkvist takes the job, which includes spending at least six months on Vanger's isolated island in the middle of winter. But what he doesn't know is that he's being spied on by twentysomething Lisbeth Salander (brilliantly played by Noomi Rapace in a career-making performance), the titular Girl and the possessor of remarkable skills as a sleuth and computer hacker. With her gothlike piercings and all-black clothes, Lisbeth is a vivid character, to say the least.

The title character--who first appeared on The Chris Rock Show--speaks a kind of slang on steroids, an incomprehensible stream of nonsense syllables that nonetheless makes him irresistible to women and a threat to evildoers everywhere. Pootie is part movie star, part superhero, righting wrongs with the slap of his daddy's belt. But when an evil corporation uses a super-ho named Ireenie (Jennifer Coolidge from Best in Show and Legally Blonde) to steal this magic belt, Pootie must find himself again. In the title role, Lance Crouther glides through the movie like Isaac Hayes's skinny younger brother, while Chris Rock lends his trademark bark to multiple roles, including Pootie's father. Crazed editing and a great soundtrack give Pootie Tang a little extra oomph. A bizarre comedy, likely to develop a cult following. Cameos by Missy Elliot and Bob Costas. --Bret Fetzer","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_featured","cat_movies-tv","list_action-movie","list_amazon-instant-movie","list_comedic-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie","list_musical-movie"],"price":9.98,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/j/Z/z/jZz-6483221.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/p/o/o/pootie-tang-7720364.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/214552873/fdd8a5318a44361a915a6733d38e91a36129cab7"],"years":"2001","stars":4.6750716491850834,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_action-movie":"Action","list_musical-movie":"Musicals","list_movie":"Movie","list_comedic-movie":"Comedies","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B000I687Z6","fb_112167318795370","flixter_m11097","freebase_04hlzh","hn_3324491","imdb_tt0258038","itunes_214552873","moviedb_10615","netflix_60020927","rt_11097"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Comedy","Musical","Adventure","Action"],"name":"Pootie Tang","language":"English","title":"Pootie Tang","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3324491/pootie-tang/","release_date":"2001-06-29","tags":["comedy","movie","action","humor","cult","campy","light-hearted","pg-13","action movie","post-1980","louis ck","musical movie","musical film","funny","comedic movie","funny movie"],"birthdate":"2001-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"Based as it is on a short skit, Pootie Tang overstays its welcome.","synopsis":"Pootie Tang, the musician/actor/folk hero of the ghetto, is chronicled from his early childhood to his battles against the evil Corporate America, who try to steal his magic belt and make him sell out by endorsing addictive products to his people.

But Manhattan is also distinguished in the realm of home video as the first motion picture to be released only in a widescreen version. You wouldn't want to see it any other way. Allen's \"Rhapsody in Gray\" concerns, as his own character puts it, \"people in Manhattan who are constantly creating these real, unnecessary, neurotic problems for themselves, because it keeps them from dealing with more unsolvable, terrifying problems about the universe.\" It's a romantic comedy about infidelity and betrayal, the rules of love and friendship, young girls (a radiant and sweet Mariel Hemingway) and older men (Allen), innocence, and sophistication. (a favorite phrase is used to describe a piece of sculpture at the Guggenheim: \"It has a marvelous kind of negative capability.\") The movie's themes can be summed up in two key lines: \"I can't believe you met somebody you like better than me,\" and \"It's very important to have some kind of personal integrity.\" OK, so they may not sound like such sparkling snatches of brilliant dialogue, but Manhattan puts those ideas acro ...","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_featured","cat_movies-tv","list_amazon-instant-movie","list_comedic-movie","list_dramatic-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie","list_romantic-movie"],"price":8.21,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/c/a/3/ca3-2972883.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0079522/dc0940b9f9b03097ff1dc2359518686205a6df5c","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/292618681/ade7053f62b2fc2f96467fc81d5bbd66f07b8db1","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/60001266/d1b25628fbf0276401129b9779f0d3380316220e"],"years":"1979","stars":4.668145005628847,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_movie":"Movie","list_romantic-movie":"Romance","list_comedic-movie":"Comedies","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B001EMXS20","fb_103787896326942","fb_104015319635503","fb_109578979068032","fb_112206972123835","fb_112918901058","fb_9078624773","flixter_m13058","freebase_0jyx6","hn_1797083","imdb_tt0079522","itunes_292618681","moviedb_696","netflix_60001266","rt_13058"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"name":"Manhattan","language":"English","title":"Manhattan","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_1797083/manhattan/","release_date":"1979-4-25","tags":["comedy","woody allen","classic","romantic","movie","romance","drama","humor","r","romantic comedies","pre-1990","woody allen acts","diane keaton era","dramatic movie","romantic films","romance movies","romcoms","funny","comedic movie","funny movie"],"birthdate":"1979-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"One of Woody Allen's early classics, Manhattan combines modern, bittersweet humor and timeless romanticism with unerring grace.","synopsis":"A divorced New Yorker currently dating a high-schooler brings himself to look for love in the mistress of his best friend instead.

As played by Liam Neeson in writer-director Bill Condon's excellent film biography, Indiana University researcher Alfred Kinsey was so consumed by statistical measurements of human sexual activity that he almost completely overlooked the substantial role of emotions and their effect on human behavior. This made him an ideal researcher and science celebrity who revealed that sexual behaviors previously considered deviant and even harmful (homosexuality, oral sex, etc.) are in fact common and essentially normal in the realm of human experience, but whose obsession with scientific method frequently placed him at odds with his understanding wife (superbly played by Laura Linney) and research assistants. In presenting Kinsey as a driven social misfit, Condon's film gives Neeson one of his finest roles while revealing the depth of Kinsey's own humanity, and the incalculable benefit his research had on our collective sexual enlightenment. With humor, charm, and intelligence, Kinsey shines a light where darkness once prevailed. --Jeff Shannon","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_movies-tv","list_amazon-instant-movie","list_biographical-movie","list_dramatic-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie"],"price":2.89,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/273394968/df6231624a235158b0a4ed84c8cf871c8b42014b","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/70011202/2127f55ac9cd5739bb09f4bbea2dd642327eab51"],"years":"2004","stars":4.664488549627769,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_biographical-movie":"Biographies","list_movie":"Movie","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B000SW4DJE","fb_105954302769035","flixter_m13114","freebase_046f3p","hn_1907243","imdb_tt0362269","itunes_273394968","moviedb_11184","netflix_70011202","rt_13114"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Biography","Drama"],"name":"Kinsey","language":"English","title":"Kinsey","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_1907243/kinsey/","release_date":"2005-1-13","tags":["movie","fashion","drama","r","biography","biographical","new wave music","turbulent lives","biographical movie","bill condon","dramatic movie","scientists-inventors"],"birthdate":"2004-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"A biopic of the sex researcher is hailed as adventurous, clever, and subversive, with fine performances by Liam Neeson and Laura Linney.","synopsis":"Called Prok as an adult (short for Professor Kinsey), Alfred Kinsey has been interested in biology since he was a child growing up in the early twentieth century, despite the criticisms of such being nonsense from his overbearing and devoutly Christian father, professor Alfred Seguine Kinsey.

But those studies in combination with questions from his students, coming to terms with the needs of sex with his own wife, a former student of his named Clara McMillen (who he calls Mac), and what he sees as the gross misinformation on the subject currently within popular belief makes him change his focus to human sexuality. Many of those gross untruths - as he sees them - are that oral sex and masturbation cause a slew of maladies, which are perpetuated by what is presented in the university's hygiene class taught by Professor Thurman Rice.","score":[0,0,4.664488549627769,false,0.9161221374069421],"image_url":"http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/b/hn/1907243/6576661991912399948","urls":["http://hunch.com/item/hn_1907243/kinsey/","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_(film)","http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppZwSABxeYE","http://www.amazon.com/Kinsey/dp/B000SW4DJE","http://www.facebook.com/pages/Kinsey/105954302769035","http://www.flixster.com/movie/kinsey/","http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kinsey/","http://www.freebase.com/view/m/046f3p","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362269/","http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/kinsey/id273394968","http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kinsey","http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/11184","http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Kinsey/70011202"],"directed_by":"Bill Condon","release_year":2004,"mpaa_rating":"R","runtime":118,"result_id":"hn_1907243","trailer":"http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi2224292121/","rt_critics_rating":"Certified Fresh"},{"rating":7.3,"rating_counts":{"itunes":63,"amz":46,"hn":0,"flixter":1811},"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_featured","cat_movies-tv","list_amazon-instant-movie","list_comedic-movie","list_dramatic-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie","list_netflix-watch-instantly","list_romantic-movie"],"is_personalized":true,"years":"2007","rt_critics_rating":"Fresh","is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B003E4B0T4","flixter_m770678217","freebase_02wxgvw","hn_3925204","imdb_tt0848542","itunes_316526034","moviedb_18290","netflix_70083538","rt_770678217"],"genres":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"preferences":[],"title":"Arranged","score":[0,0,4.663426578901744,false,0.9158566447254359],"affiliate_links":[],"stars":4.663426578901744,"average_ratings":{"rt":64,"netflix":4.0,"itunes":4.5,"amz":4.28261,"imdb":7.3,"flixter":0.89},"mpaa_rating":"NR","mpaa_ratings":["NR","Unrated"],"description":"ARRANGED centers on the friendship between an Orthodox Jewish woman and a Muslim woman who meet as first-year teachers at a public school in Brooklyn.

Heading for the wheat fields of Texas, he packs up his girlfriend (Brooke Adams) and his younger sister (Linda Manz). Instead of a better life, they head straight into tragedy when a wealthy farmer (Sam Shepard) falls for Adams. Believing him to be dying and expecting to inherit a fortune, she agrees to marry him. Their plans change when Shepard fails to die and Gere takes matters into his own hands. Aesthetically flawless, this film about a romantic love triangle is diminished by the small scope of video. Originally shown in 70mm, it is an eye-catching period piece that won its cinematographer, N\u00e9stor Almendros, a 1978 Oscar. Texture and color are the unbilled characters in this tragic tale, and are just as important as the players. The story, sadly, fades somewhat when compared to the glory of the visuals. --Rochelle O'Gorman","tags":["romantic","movie","romance","drama","romantic comedies","dramatic movie","romantic films","romance movies","romcoms"],"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/y/X/K/yXK-8772471.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/d/a/y/days-of-heaven-8811144.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/291760532/20e054d9107219b89e56d81ecf9abd9037f777d1","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/16642/e7085cf89a30d301b163c729ad614862c05c26fe","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/425166/b53bff2b560424a24bfa0e48788cbcc2c16c7543","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/rt/10859/a5b09c3f2e39d0008f7abe003dcb3c8a32456fa5"],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_romantic-movie":"Romance","list_movie":"Movie","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"release_year":1978,"name":"Days of Heaven","language":"English","is_saved":false,"url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3540521/days-of-heaven/","release_date":"1978-09-13","popularity":0,"birthdate":"1978-01-01","synopsis":"Bill and Abby, a young couple who to the outside world pretend to be brother and sister are living and working in Chicago at the beginning of the century.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has no shortage of breathtaking battles, but it also has the dramatic soul of a Greek tragedy and the sweep of an epic romance. This is the work of director Ang Lee, who fell in love with movies while watching wuxia films as a youngster and made Crouching Tiger as a tribute to the form. To elevate the genre above its B-movie roots and broaden its appeal, Lee did two important things. First, he assembled an all-star lineup of talent, joining the famous Asian actors Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh with the striking, charismatic newcomer Zhang Ziyi. Behind the scenes, Lee called upon cinematographer Peter Pau (The Killer, The Bride with White Hair) and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, best known outside Asia for his work on The Matrix. Second, in adapting the story from a Chinese pulp-fiction novel written by Wang Du Lu, Lee focused not on the pursuit of a legendary sword known as \"The Green Destiny,\" but instead on the struggles of his female leads against social obligation.

Based on a lesser-known book by children's author Roald Dahl (who wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach), the movie is the work of Wes Anderson (writer-director of Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums), who expanded and elaborated on the original story; the combination is inspired. Anderson's sensibility--his fondness for meticulous compositions, coordinated colors, and narrative filigree--can sometimes seem finicky and stiff in live-action movies, but it's exquisitely suited to the painstaking art of stop-motion animation. Every corner of the screen crackles with visual invention and whimsical humor. The top-notch vocal cast (which also features Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Michael Gambon, Owen Wilson, and others) create vivid personalities that perfectly mesh with the movie's lush colors and luscious textures. The Fantastic Mr. Fox is an off-beat gem, a giddy mix of adult emotional issues, wild animal behavior, and childlike delight. --Bret Fetzer","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_featured","cat_movies-tv","list_action-movie","list_amazon-instant-movie","list_animated-movie","list_animation","list_comedic-movie","list_family-movie","list_movie"],"price":9.99,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/V/R/l/VRl-4652343.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/f/a/n/fantastic-mr-fox-8209574.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/a/y/L/ayL-3786463.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/amz/B003DNN0L2/db7d5e33c6fb3647ba6299a8133ca2d734eb15f8","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0432283/11d14d6fa8069728a7365423d86db1e9f191d019","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/10315/b58b493f620b4e320def4920a3a4025e68bacf42","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/70109889/cd9128a875df654f7c3a5d0ce0d55c66849bb09b"],"years":"2009","stars":4.655878723051044,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_animated-movie":"Animated","list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_action-movie":"Action","list_family-movie":"Family","list_movie":"Movie","list_animation":"Animated","list_comedic-movie":"Comedies"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B003DNN0L2","fb_134744959738","fb_78703162334","flixter_m770685760","freebase_08s6mr","hn_2889963","imdb_tt0432283","moviedb_10315","netflix_70109889","rt_770685760"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"name":"Fantastic Mr. Fox","language":"English","title":"Fantastic Mr. Fox","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_2889963/fantastic-mr-fox/","release_date":"2009-11-25","tags":["comedy","movie","animation","adults","suburban","action","humor","youtube","parenting","pg","stop motion","family films","self-loathing","animated movie","bill murray","wes anderson","kids movies","owen wilson","action movie","childrens movies","stylized","cartoon movie","feature-length","ensamble","take charge","funny","kid-safe movies","comedic movie","funny movie"],"birthdate":"2009-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"Fantastic Mr. Fox is a delightfully funny feast for the eyes with multi-generational appeal -- and it shows Wes Anderson has a knack for animation.","synopsis":"An urbane fox cannot resist returning to his farm raiding ways and then must help his community survive the farmers' retaliation.

Granted, few Oscar winners have walked a more diverse path. After a series of documentaries and remakes, the Silence of the Lambs helmer tries his hand at the intimate chamber drama. With the help of actress Anne Hathaway and screenwriter Jenny Lumet, daughter of filmmaker Sidney, he pulls it off. The festivities kick into high gear once Kym (Hathaway, with smeared eyeliner and unkempt hair) takes a break from rehab for her sister's big day. It soon transpires that Kym, who hides her wounded soul behind a veil of sarcasm, serves as the Buchman's resident black sheep. The problem goes deeper than drugs to a tragedy in which she played a part. As Kym, bride Rachel (Mad Men's Rosemary DeWitt), their parents (Bill Irwin and Debra Winger), groom Sidney (TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe), and the rest of the bohemian Connecticut brood struggle with the past, the nuptials continue, graced by performances from past Demme collaborators like Sister Carol East (Something Wild) and Robyn Hitchcock (Storefront Hitchcock).

Inspired by Stansfield Turner's Burn Before Reading, the comically convoluted plot clicks into gear when the CIA gives analyst Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) the boot. Little does Cox know his wife, Katie (Tilda Swinton, riffing on her Michael Clayton character), is seeing married federal marshal Harry (George Clooney, Swinton's Clayton co-star, playing off his Syriana role). To get back at the Agency, Cox works on his memoirs. Through a twist of fate, fitness club workers Linda (Frances McDormand) and Chad (Brad Pitt in a pompadour that recalls Johnny Suede) find the disc and try to wrangle a \"Samaratin tax\" out of the surly alcoholic. An avid Internet dater, Linda plans to use the money for plastic surgery, oblivious that her manager, Ted (The Visitor's Richard Jenkins), likes her just the way she is. Though it sounds like a Beltway remake of The Big Lebowski, the Coen entry it most closely resembles, this time the brothers concentrate their energies on the myriad insecurities endemic to the mid-life crisis--with the exception of Chad, who's too dense to share such concerns, leading to the funniest performance of Pitt's career.

Max Bialystock was once the king of Broadway, but now all his shows close on opening night. Things turn around when he's visited by the neurotic accountant Leo Bloom, who proposes a scheme tailor-made for producers who can only make flops: raise far more money than you need, then make sure the show is despised. No one will be interested in it, so you can pocket the surplus. To this end, they produce a musical called Springtime for Hitler written by escaped Nazi Franz Liebken.

Based on the true story of playboy congressman Wilson's efforts to fund Afghanistan's defense against the Soviet invasion of the 1980s, the film is borne along on breezy attitude and a peppery script by West Wing scribe Aaron Sorkin. Wilson, played by Tom Hanks (who also produced), is the perfect hero for this kind of tale, because there's nothing perfect or heroic about him: He's a highball-swilling, fanny-pinching gadabout who becomes radicalized on the issue of helping the Afghans against their mighty aggressor. He has help in the form of a right-wing Texas anti-Communist (Julia Roberts) with a genius for raising money, and a sardonic CIA operative (Philip Seymour Hoffman, stealing the show) who lacks all the social skills Wilson has in abundance. Sorkin's syncopated speech is just the ticket for director Mike Nichols, who understands exactly how to keep this kind of political comedy popping (the complicated story comes in at a hair over 90 minutes, amazingly). Some scoundrels are on the right side of the angels, and the movie's Charlie Wilson is one of them. --Robert Horton    Beyond Charlie Wilson's War on DVD    More Tom Hanks   Films by Mike Nichols    More Julia Roberts    Stills from Charlie Wilson's War (Click for larger image)","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_featured","cat_movies-tv","list_amazon-instant-movie","list_biographical-movie","list_comedic-movie","list_dramatic-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie"],"price":2.62,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/7/O/C/7OC-9919754.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/S/a/R/SaR-9919784.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/278172404/aa64f1fac248f12785b4090f8b5b93a6dd90cc15","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/70060021/77f86e86d8765466652918d64916ec45cd7e90b8"],"years":"2007","stars":4.643032886888287,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_biographical-movie":"Biographies","list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_movie":"Movie","list_comedic-movie":"Comedies","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B001AQSVPE","fb_107628252593028","fb_16714178379","flixter_m770673565","freebase_09q23x","hn_2082133","imdb_tt0472062","itunes_278172404","moviedb_6538","netflix_70060021","rt_770673565"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Biography","Comedy","Drama","History"],"name":"Charlie Wilson's War","language":"English","title":"Charlie Wilson's War","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_2082133/charlie-wilsons-war/","release_date":"2007-12-21","tags":["comedy","texas","movie","media","drama","political","humor","little","smart","r","war","average","serious","afghanistan","congressman","www","tom hanks","biography","biographical","cia","2000s","mike nichols","mujahideen","charlie wilson","philip seymour hoffman","julia roberts","well-known","leading role","biographical movie","dramatic movie","seymour hoffman","philip seymour","acted","funny","history","historic","comedic movie","funny movie","historic movie"],"birthdate":"2007-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"Charlie Wilson's War manages to entertain and inform audiences, thanks to its witty script and talented cast of power players.","synopsis":"A drama based on a Texas congressman Charlie Wilson's covert dealings in Afghanistan, where his efforts to assist rebels in their war with the Soviets have some unforeseen and long-reaching effects.

Soran Ebrahim stars as Satellite, a boy nicknamed for his obsession with technology. Satellite is also obsessed with the United States, and sprinkles bits of English throughout his speech. His strong personality and his resourcefulness have made him a leader among the younger children in the village. He even convinces the village elders to trade in their radios and purchase a satellite dish so they can watch news broadcasts on the upcoming war. Tension mounts as the village waits to hear when the U.S. will invade. For his part, Satellite finds himself smitten with an orphan girl, Agrin (Avaz Latif), who wanders into the refugee camp with her armless older brother, Henkov (Hirsh Feyssal), and a little boy who is nearly blind. Henkov earns a meager living clearing minefields, like Satellite, so Satellite sees him, at first, as a rival. But his earnest desire to help Agrin eventually extends to her family.

Commercial and music-video director Tarsem has piled these visions into an elaborate remake of an obscure Bulgarian film, Yo Ho Ho, which is anchored in (but by no means limited to) a quiet hospital during the silent-movie era. A stunt man (Lee Pace) is laid up with leg injuries, and an eye-popping black-and-white prologue (utterly mystifying while we're watching it) tells us how he got here. Depressed over his disability and a recent lost love, he plans suicide, but is temporarily derailed by the inquisitive friendship of a little girl (Catinca Untaru), to whom he tells wild stories of adventurers and princesses. We see these stories, which is where the dizzying visuals come in. This movie probably won't inspire many lukewarm responses: either you'll fall madly for this paean to storytelling magic, or you'll be suspicious about the parade of pretty pictures, which tend to have a magazine-layout sheen. The movie certainly has more soul than Tarsem's yucky previous feature, The Cell, and the scenes between Pace and Untaru (who scores an 11 on the cuteness scale) are genuinely charming. The director actually put a considerable amount of his own money into the production (which shot in over 20 countries), and whether you buy his vision or not, he put his money on t ...","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_approved","cat_entertainment-media","cat_movies-tv","list_dramatic-movie","list_horror-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie","list_science-fiction-movie"],"price":15.15,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0460791/574e30b008a2c5b89c384a8280b73c54165cf635","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/rt/770686760/9dab5647754dd248c245ee4975081fd647a43e50"],"years":"2006","stars":4.627434516763282,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_horror-movie":"Horror","list_movie":"Movie","list_science-fiction-movie":"Sci-fi","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B001FQIWSK","fb_106178009413785","fb_112364222108482","fb_264237451275","fb_31159550889","flixter_m770686760","freebase_047gs5d","hn_2214713","imdb_tt0460791","itunes_291721221","moviedb_14784","netflix_70099619","rt_770686760"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"name":"The Fall","language":"English","title":"The Fall","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_2214713/the-fall/","release_date":"2008-5-9","tags":["indian","movie","drama","fantasy","hospital","magic","science fiction","horror","sci-fi","r","surrealist","governor","us","dream","bandit","quest","2000s","fantasy movie","the fall","pushing daisies","horror movie","science fiction films","sci-fi movies","fantasy films","scary movie","set in the present","lee pace","tarsem","tarsem singh","dramatic movie","cinematografie"],"birthdate":"2006-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"More visually elaborate than the fragmented story can sometimes support, The Fall walks the line between labor of love and filmmaker self-indulgence.","synopsis":"The Fall is a 2006 adventure fantasy film directed by Tarsem Singh, starring Lee Pace, Catinca Untaru, and Justine Waddell.[1] It is based on the screenplay of the 1981 Bulgarian film Yo Ho Ho by Valeri Petrov.[2]  The film earned $3.2 million worldwide.

With over 300 registered superheroes in the United States, we'll definitively uncover the 'Real-Life Superhero' cultural phenomenon and discover what inspired these everyday citizens to take the law in to their own hands as they try to make the world a better and safer place for all.","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_approved","cat_entertainment-media","cat_featured","cat_movies-tv","list_action-movie","list_comedic-movie","list_documentary","list_dramatic-movie","list_movie"],"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/u/G/S/uGS-10740472.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/70170289/59fd292c87ec01102c4112226cc45ad51804a730"],"years":"2011","stars":4.626999567894105,"mpaa_rating":"NR","lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_action-movie":"Action","list_comedic-movie":"Comedies","list_documentary":"Documentaries","list_movie":"Movie"},"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["freebase_0gd3fk7","hn_3823421","imdb_tt1792621","netflix_70170289"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Documentary","Action","Comedy","Drama"],"name":"Superheroes","language":"English","title":"Superheroes","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3823421/superheroes/","release_date":"2011-01-01","tags":["comedy","movie","justice","drama","action","humor","crime","documentary","documentary film","vigilante","action movie","mike barnett","dramatic movie","funny","hbo","comedic movie","funny movie"],"birthdate":"2011-01-01","popularity":0,"synopsis":"A journey inside the world of real life caped crusaders.

He hurries to be first in line to sign up with the Confederate Army, but is rejected because he is too valuable in his present job. On leaving, he runs into Annabelle's father and brother, who beckon to him to join them in line, but he sadly walks away, giving them the impression that he does not want to enlist.

Ripper (Sterling Hayden), a maniacal warrior obsessed with \"the purity of precious bodily fluids,\" mounts his singular campaign against Communism by ordering a squadron of B-52 bombers to attack the Soviet Union. The Soviets counter the threat with a so-called \"Doomsday Device,\" and the world hangs in the balance while the U.S. president (Peter Sellers) engages in hilarious hot-line negotiations with his Soviet counterpart. Sellers also plays a British military attach\u00e9 and the mad bomb-maker Dr. Strangelove; George C. Scott is outrageously frantic as General Buck Turgidson, whose presidential advice consists mainly of panic and statistics about \"acceptable losses.\" With dialogue (\"You can't fight here! This is the war room!\") and images (Slim Pickens's character riding the bomb to oblivion) that have become a part of our cultural vocabulary, Kubrick's film regularly appears on critics' lists of the all-time best. --Jeff Shannon","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_featured","cat_movies-tv","list_amazon-instant-movie","list_comedic-movie","list_dramatic-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie"],"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/d/O/V/dOV-9189444.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/Q/q/Y/QqY-3368533.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/w/X/C/wXC-3440794.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/B/e/5/Be5-3616103.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/amz/B000ZHCQ5U/80d0c66c2a959afda958a0e9adff8a4d619d5dee","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/flixter/m12368/473c281f51044b1e38f83852643cc35ae40081d0","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0057012/e5fb07341cad2006cf62aab135d3d882e8fbc406","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/263616854/09298cc6044e1399dea0ae28fbced7c6c82d9eb0"],"years":"1964","stars":4.607604677606057,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_movie":"Movie","list_comedic-movie":"Comedies","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B000ZHCQ5U","fb_108320852528771","fb_108602739163898","fb_109504635734027","fb_12898975793","fb_13933304514","flixter_m12368","freebase_02dwj","hn_3575494","imdb_tt0057012","itunes_263616854","moviedb_935","netflix_60020009","rt_12368"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Comedy","Drama"],"name":"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb","language":"English","title":"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3575494/dr-strangelove/","release_date":"1964-01-29","tags":["comedy","classic","dark","movie","drama","date night","black and white","humor","cult","fiction","impressive","thriller","tragedy","artistic","obscure","1960s","violent","dark comedy","clever","campy","light-hearted","pg","profound","good ending","the cold war","rainy day","pg-13","slow-paced","humorous","well-known","major studio","jovial","with friends","pre-1980","dramatic movie","funny","stanley kubrick","comedic movie","funny movie"],"birthdate":"1964-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"Stanley Kubrick's brilliant Cold War satire remains as funny and razor-sharp today as it was in 1964.","synopsis":"An insane general starts a process to nuclear holocaust that a war room of politicians and generals frantically try to stop.

But beware the major difference between the experience of stage and screen, because A Chorus Line is a perfect example of a show that doesn't translate well from one medium to another. Director Richard Attenborough gives it his best shot, cutting some of the production numbers and adding new ones while \"opening up\" the show to explore the off-stage lives of struggling performers as they prepare for another grueling audition. Michael Douglas plays the harsh, workaholic director who puts the auditioning \"gypsies\" through the paces, winnowing a large group of hopefuls down to eight lucky cast members for his next big show. There's a subplot about the director's former girlfriend, who returns for the big audition, and along the way the other hopefuls sing and dance while revealing their various hopes and fears. On screen, the musical works best when focused on its dramatic passages; otherwise it's impossible to escape the fact that this material is best suited to live performance. --Jeff Shannon","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_movies-tv","list_amazon-instant-movie","list_dramatic-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie","list_musical-movie"],"price":5.94,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/f/o/2/fo2-3554483.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/a/-/c/a-chorus-line-4550194.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0088915/05116e56473944ec7ca2b33eedac2f1fa134b5be","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/323470800/70427e65e10f14ef01262b16fa947ba9f9b3aa87","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/1816/aa0a8239b197a63aadc1784f8caee9dc565fef79"],"years":"1985","stars":4.603310706668701,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_musical-movie":"Musicals","list_movie":"Movie","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["amz_B002XZOZQA","fb_108581065833243","flixter_m10588","freebase_0fbphd","hn_2174953","imdb_tt0088915","itunes_323470800","moviedb_1816","netflix_60010012","rt_10588"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Drama","Music","Musical"],"name":"A Chorus Line","language":"English","title":"A Chorus Line","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_2174953/a-chorus-line/","release_date":"1985-12-13","tags":["dance","movie","drama","professionals","older","pg-13","ensamble cast","story about dance","well-known dancers","musical movie","richard attenborough","dramatic movie","musical film"],"birthdate":"1985-01-01","popularity":0,"synopsis":"Hopefuls try out before a demanding director for a part in a new musical.

Written by actor/screenwriter Dan Futterman and based on selected chapters from the biography by Gerald Clarke, this mercilessly perceptive drama shows how Truman Capote brought about his own self-destruction in the course of writing In Cold Blood, the \"nonfiction novel\" that was immediately acclaimed as a literary milestone. After learning of brutal killings in rural Holcomb, Kansas, in November 1959, Capote gained the confidence of captured killers Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) in an effort to tell their story, but he ultimately sacrificed his soul in the process of writing his greatest book. Hoffman transcends mere mimicry to create an utterly authentic, psychologically tormented portrait of an insincere artist who was not above lying and manipulation to get what he needed. Bennett Miller's intimate direction focuses on the consequences of Capote's literary ambition, tempered by an equally fine performance by Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, Capote's friend and the author of To Kill a Mockingbird, who served as Capote's quiet voice of conscience. Spanning the seven-year period between the Kansas murders and the publication of In Cold Blood in 1966, Capote reveals the many faces of a writer who grew too close to his subjects, losing his moral compass as they were fitted with a hangman's noose.  ...","tags":["movie","drama","date night","crime","blockbuster","award-winning","1950s","1960s","biography","biographical","pg-13","crime movie","biopic","good cinematography","major studio release","2000 and later","mystery movie","biographical movie","dramatic movie","history","historic","historic movie"],"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/c/a/p/capote-4569434.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/P/o/4/Po4-3514593.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0379725/2c99b4ce2b162eb3aae567ea31a7b31e316b17d8"],"rt_critics_consensus":"Philip Seymour Hoffman's riveting central performance guides a well-constructed retelling of the most sensational and significant period in author Truman Capote's life.","lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_biographical-movie":"Biographies","list_movie":"Movie","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"release_year":2005,"name":"Capote","language":"English","is_saved":false,"url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3581354/capote/","release_date":"2006-02-03","popularity":0,"birthdate":"2005-01-01","synopsis":"In 1959, Truman Capote, a popular writer for The New Yorker, learns about the horrific and senseless murder of a family of four in Holcomb, Kansas. Inspired by the story material, Capote and his partner, Harper Lee, travel to the town to research for an article. However, as Capote digs deeper into the story, he is inspired to expand the project into what would be his greatest work, In Cold Blood. To that end, he arranges extensive interviews with the prisoners, especially with Perry Smith, a quiet and articulate man with a troubled history. As he works on his book, Capote feels some compassion for Perry which in part prompts him to help the prisoners to some degree. However, that feeling deeply conflicts with his need for closure for his book which only an execution can provide. That conflict and the mixed motives for both interviewer and subject make for a troubling experience that would produce an literary account that would redefine modern non-fiction.","image_url":"http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/b/hn/3581354/3880047152079788698","urls":["http://hunch.com/item/hn_3581354/capote/","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capote_(film)","http://www.facebook.com/pages/Capote/108148985873886","http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379725/","http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/capote","http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/capote?q=%20Capote","http://www.amazon.com/Capote/dp/B001MKQS4O","http://www.flixster.com/movie/capote/","http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1151898-capote/","http://www.freebase.com/view/m/092vkg","http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/capote/id298594926","http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1151898-capote","http://www.themoviedb.org/movie/398","http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Capote/70038130"],"directed_by":"Bennett Miller","wildcard":false,"runtime":114,"result_id":"hn_3581354","trailer":"http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi4173070617/"},{"average_ratings":{"rt":65,"netflix":3.0,"itunes":4.0,"amz":3.5,"imdb":5.7,"flixter":0.42,"hn":3.25},"mpaa_ratings":["R"],"rating_counts":{"itunes":56,"amz":44,"hn":12,"flixter":8811},"rating":5.7,"description":"Smiley Face is a 2007 American/German comedy film written by Dylan Haggerty and directed and co-produced by Gregg Araki.

Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland play a seemingly happy couple who lose the older of their two sons to a boating accident; Timothy Hutton plays the surviving teenage son, who blames himself for his brother's death and has attempted suicide to end his pain. They live in a meticulously kept home in an affluent Chicago suburb, never allowing themselves to speak openly of the grief that threatens to tear them apart. Only when the son begins to see a psychiatrist (Judd Hirsch) does the veneer of denial begin to crack, and Ordinary People thenceforth directly examines the broken family ties and the complexity of repressed emotions that have festered under the pretense of coping. Superior performances and an Oscar-winning script by Alvin Sargent make this one of the most uncompromising dramas ever made about the psychology of dysfunctional families. There are moments--particularly related to Mary Tyler Moore's anguished performance as a woman incapable of expressing her deepest emotions--when this film is both intensely involving and heartbreakingly real. No matter how happy and healthy your upbringing was, there's something in this excellent film that everyone can relate to. --Jeff Shannon","tags":["movie","drama","blockbuster","award-winning","1980s","r-rated","good cinematography","major studio release","dramatic movie"],"price":7.03,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/272603413/b533eebb383614f34714d3492a2043dbd2d12cd8"],"rt_critics_consensus":"Though shot through with bitterness and sorrow, Robert Redford's directorial debut is absorbing and well-acted.","lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_movie":"Movie","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"release_year":1980,"name":"Ordinary People ","language":"English","is_saved":false,"url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_2039003/ordinary-people/","release_date":"1981-02-27","popularity":0,"birthdate":"1980-01-01","synopsis":"Beth, Calvin, and their son Conrad are living in the aftermath of the death of the other son.

The squirmy laughs are laced with humiliation and the satire is acidic and cynical; in the world of Solondz, victims and victimizers alike are petty, selfish, vindictive, and thoughtless, and empathy is strictly rationed.

Dahan's portrait begins with Piaf's stay in a brothel as a young girl. Left to the care of her grandmother (who runs the place) after her father pulls her away from a narcissistic mother, Piaf undergoes significant health problems and grows up to sing on the street in lieu of outright prostitution. The film pulses along with the usual biopic rhythms, with pivotal moments in the life of Piaf (played as an adult by Marion Cotillard) turning up regularly only to be smacked aside by the unseen hand of perpetual misfortune. There's the impresario (Gerard Depardieu) who recognizes Piaf's great but raw talent only to have a run-in with the criminal element around her. There's the heavyweight fighter (Marcel Cerdan) who becomes the love of Piaf's life but can't be with her. Drug addiction, random car accidents, tax problems, you name it, it's all here, topped by an unnerving revelation that pops up in La Vie en Rose's final moments. After awhile, with such a concentration of bad news squeezed into 140 minutes, one begins to wish Dahan had taken a more expansive approach to Piaf's life and times.

A century later, Michel Gondry works very much in the spirit of his artistic predecessor and countryman, creating films and music videos that feel just as hand-crafted and visually fantastical. The Science of Sleep concerns the flirtations and misunderstandings of St\u00e9phane (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Babel), an aspiring visual artist, and St\u00e9phanie (Charlotte Gainsbourg, 21 Grams), his Parisian neighbor who creates whimsical sculptures from cotton balls and felt. As St\u00e9phane toils in a caustic office for a company that makes calendars, he retreats into his dreams and finds them increasingly hard to distinguish from reality, and vice-versa. The Science of Sleep is a trilingual film, with dialogue spoken in French, English, and Spanish by characters who are very much global citizens, crossing boundaries of consciousness as easily as they cross boundaries of culture. Gondry decorates his love story with deliberately low-tech special effects, including cellophane made to look like bath water and a subconscious television studio constructed largely of corrugated cardboard. This is filmmaking with all the seams and stitches exposed, an appreciation for the patent falseness of films that nonetheless transport and enchant us.

They include the bookworm Christian who is the eldest, the dumb jock Antoine who is third, and the youngest Yvan. But Zac has the most contempt for his second eldest brother, the shiftless druggie Raymond. To his devout Catholic mother, Zac is her miracle son, both for being born the same day as Jesus Christ (a fact which Zac has always hated), and because a Tupperware-selling mystic once told her that he has the power to heal. Laurianne has always coddled Zac, the two who have a special if unspoken bond. But Zac wants more to please his father, who wants more than anything in his sons that they grow up to be man's men and not sissies.

The script follows the entwined paths of Apple's Steve Jobs and Microsoft's Bill Gates with a pointed sense of the cultural divide between the hip, self-absorbed Apple cofounder and the brilliant alpha geek behind Microsoft's eventual software empire, contrasting the Mac's countercultural underpinnings with the PC's more strait-laced origins.  But Pirates of Silicon Valley seemingly can't decide whether it wants to be a serious-minded history of these key figures in the personal computer revolution or a trashy wallow in the more ignoble foibles of its principals. As a result, it falls short of exacting history while never achieving the guilty pleasure it might have.

Eyewear and a comb-over do nearly as well for Anthony Michael Hall, who also grafts some of Bill Gates's better-known mannerisms onto his performance and renders Gates as a smart if socially maladroit entrepreneur who, like Jobs, provides the ambition and business savvy to exploit his partner's computing talents.

Collaborating with costar and cowriter Eugene Levy (who gives the film's funniest performance), Guest is so delicate in his satirical approach that the laughs aren't always obvious, and the subtlety can be as wistful (as in Catherine O'Hara's performance as Levy's auto-harpist partner) as it is hilarious. Some may wish for more blatant comedy, but that would compromise the genuine affection that Guest & Co. have for the music they're spoofing. --Jeff Shannon","tags":["comedy","movie","musical","teenagers","humor","recent","musical movie","musical film","funny","comedic movie","funny movie"],"price":1.48,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/0/i/m/0im-3876823.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/a/-/m/a-mighty-wind-4526564.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/371850466/ac7c79c7f971234c8696f433b0f0b703dc4712c6","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/rt/10423/b18af7c9e6d0219dc90953c931c61328ec760461"],"rt_critics_consensus":"Though not as uproariously funny as Guest's previous movies, A Mighty Wind is also more heartfelt.","lists":{"list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_musical-movie":"Musicals","list_movie":"Movie","list_comedic-movie":"Comedies","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"release_year":2003,"name":"A Mighty Wind","language":"English","is_saved":false,"url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_2435993/a-mighty-wind/","release_date":"2003-05-09","popularity":0,"birthdate":"2003-01-01","synopsis":"When folk icon Irving Steinbloom passed away, he left behind a legacy of music and a family of performers he has shepherded to folk stardom.

There's Mitch and Mickey, who were the epitome of young love until their partnership was torn apart by heartbreak; classic troubadours The Folksmen, whose records were endlessly entertaining for anyone able to punch a hole in the center to play them; and The New Main Street Singers, the most meticulously color-coordinated neuftet ever to hit an amusement park.

After several one-by-one dalliances with the local whore, Snow White, and a cautionary lecture on the history, geography and culture of Afghanistan (which most of the men sleep through), the trainees head off to battle - first to the Bagram air base, then to the Afghani province of Khost to secure supply lines. But nothing can begin to prepare them for the brutal devastation into which they are plunged, or the relentless tide of slaughter that scatters thousands of Soviet victims in its wake.","tags":["movie","drama","action","war","online video","war movie","action movie","netflix streaming","dramatic movie","history","historic","historic movie"],"lists":{"list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_action-movie":"Action","list_netflix-watch-instantly":"Netflix Streaming","list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_war-movie":"War","list_movie":"Movie"},"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0417397/449d53034cd9d57b6979fef12dd2295ad6268b78","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/14097/2aa83c8834dfa450687fc3f99885391886e6e25e","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/70140536/3bfb2d1bbd1e3d1c473848844e1558c22153c9cc"],"release_year":2005,"name":"9th Company","language":"English","is_saved":false,"url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3940234/9th-company/","release_date":"2005-09-29","popularity":0,"birthdate":"2005-01-01","synopsis":"9th COMPANY recounts a year in the shared lives of a group of young soldiers drafted to serve in Afghanistan during the final year of the Soviet conflict.

The often-imitated fact-based plot (see The Karate Kid) centers upon the rigorous training process undergone in the mid-19th century by the anti-Manchu Chinese patriot San Te (Gordon Liu). It's depicted as a grueling voyage into the unknown. Cast out of his home village when he stands up to the cruel warlord (Lo Lieh) who slaughtered his parents, the refugee seeks out the martial monks of the Shaolin Temple, who steer him through a torturous series of \"chambers\"--horrendous ordeals designed to build strength and agility--before he's even allowed to study boxing or swordfighting. Finally he defeats a rival by inventing a brand-new weapon, the three-section chain-linked staff. But innovation can be carried only so far; when San Te suggests opening a \"36th chamber\" in the temple that would teach Shaolin techniques to the populace at large (so that they can fight the nasty Manchus) he is drummed out of the corps.

It's not hard to understand why: Michael Powell and Emerich Pressburger's dark fairy tale presents the ballet as an exquisite, magical work of art; but under the theatrics and glory is an all-consuming lifestyle with the power to destroy those who love it perhaps too much. Moira Shearer practically glows as Victoria \"Vicky\" Page, a young woman consumed by a will to dance who is accepted into the highly prestigious ballet company run by perfectionist Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook). Meanwhile, a gifted young composer, Julian Craster (Marius Goring), is brought on board as an orchestra coach, and later conductor and composer of the ballet that will make Vicky's name: The Red Shoes, one of the most beautiful and dramatic dances ever captured on film. Professional and personal jealousies soon pull this creative team apart, however, and Vicky is torn between her love of Julian, her responsibility to Boris, and her need to dance. Powell and Pressburger recast Hans Christian Andersen's sad story as a modern romantic melodrama, highlighted by beautiful dances and shot, not as stage ballets, but rather as expressionist cinematic dramas on impossibly grand sets awash with bold color and beautifully captured in glorious Technicolor by cinematographer Jack Cardiff. It's a brilliant melding of dance and drama as Vicky's real life mirror's the tragic story she da ...","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_movies-tv","list_dramatic-movie","list_movie","list_netflix-watch-instantly","list_romantic-movie"],"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/I/s/b/Isb-9189944.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/4/I/i/4Ii-8662901.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/t/h/e/the-red-shoes-8081904.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0040725/dd42f97ee4b98cc936292938206e9c1929f5d65c","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/19542/3a06f04b076a7383a40e703733905ec130f9cbd8"],"years":"1948","stars":4.534752342198634,"mpaa_rating":"R","lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_romantic-movie":"Romance","list_netflix-watch-instantly":"Netflix Streaming","list_movie":"Movie"},"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["fb_109192439099147","fb_12263802467","fb_189308849602","flixter_m18709","freebase_0gcq8","hn_3575994","imdb_tt0040725","moviedb_19542","netflix_897781","rt_18709"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Drama","Romance","Music"],"name":"The Red Shoes","language":"English","title":"The Red Shoes","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3575994/the-red-shoes/","release_date":"1948-10-22","tags":["romantic","dance","movie","romance","drama","professionals","online video","older","michael powell","netflix streaming","romantic comedies","well-known actors","story involves dance","dramatic movie","romantic films","romance movies","romcoms"],"birthdate":"1948-01-01","popularity":0,"synopsis":"Under the authoritarian rule of charismatic ballet impressario Boris Lermontov, his proteges realize the full promise of their talents, but at a price: utter devotion to their art and complete loyalty to Lermontov himself.

As he does in his later corruption commentaries such as Serpico or Q & A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of \"reasonable doubt,\" Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own teleplay) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast. Still, it's Lumet's claustrophobic direction--all sweaty close-ups and cramped compositions within a one-room setting--that really transforms this contrived story into an explosive and compelling nail-biter. --Dave McCoy","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_movies-tv","list_dramatic-movie","list_itunes-instant-movie","list_movie"],"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/Y/q/q/Yqq-9192174.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/Y/1/z/Y1z-10802971.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0050083/266ab2f4338a992f1bdc9acb16eb5de8d488fb39","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/299020164/44bab73ec0f214f60da1e2313214feb513778ae8","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/60004251/833c9d9fff53848888b7e422a1161562e31127a7"],"years":"1957","stars":4.533414762875303,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_movie":"Movie","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["fb_105634886138092","fb_109525182407653","fb_182189503689","fb_8615836051","flixter_m18108","freebase_0m_tj","hn_3578224","imdb_tt0050083","itunes_299020164","moviedb_389","netflix_60004251","rt_18108"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Drama"],"name":"12 Angry Men","language":"English","title":"12 Angry Men","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_3578224/12-angry-men/","release_date":"1957-04-01","tags":["classic","movie","drama","black and white","impressive","sidney lumet","rainy day","critically-acclaimed","dramatic movie","tv-pg"],"birthdate":"1957-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"Sidney Lumet's feature debut is a superbly written, dramatically effective courtroom thriller that rightfully stands as a modern classic.","synopsis":"A dissenting juror in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court.

After the success of Pulp Fiction, John Travolta continued his meteoric comeback as Chili Palmer, a Mob \"mechanic\" whose latest assignment takes him to Los Angeles, where his fascination with the movie business turns into a new career as a would-be movie producer. He pitches ideas with a sleazy producer (Gene Hackman) and a major star (Danny DeVito), and also finds time to deal with a vengeful Mobster (Dennis Farina) and assorted Hollywood types (including Renee Russo and Delroy Lindo) who all want their piece of a tempting show-biz pie. The plot unfolds with enticing precision, but it's really Elmore's snappy dialogue--and the performances that bring it to life--that make this one of the best comedies of the 1990s. --Jeff Shannon","tags":["comedy","movie","humor","crime","thriller","1990s","crime movie","mystery movie","thriller movie","funny","comedic movie","funny movie","thriller film"],"image_urls":["http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/U/7/j/U7j-4506474.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0113161/2d9025d6ac488b29625f2c5f97b3be3b8e75ba2e","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/itunes/328091699/51f289c670bbd7a009eee9d9849e57d9dcfde781","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/8012/1db233641766d299e02c927fce783bfd97f27b5d"],"lists":{"list_amazon-instant-movie":"Amazon Instant Movies","list_movie":"Movie","list_comedic-movie":"Comedies","list_thriller-movie":"Thrillers","list_itunes-instant-movie":"iTunes Instant Movies"},"release_year":1995,"name":"Get Shorty","language":"English","is_saved":false,"url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_2851564/get-shorty/","release_date":"1995-10-20","popularity":0,"birthdate":"1995-01-01","synopsis":"Some guys get all the luck, whether they like it or not.

The son of a martial-arts master whose greatest strength was his restraint, Huo grows into an unbeatable fighter whose pride and thoughtlessness lead to a chain of tragic losses. After a classic wanderer-in-the-wilderness penance, Huo reinvents himself as a mature instructor of Wushu, a martial arts system that embraces all forms of fighting without preference or pre-judgement. He also becomes a populist symbol, at the dawn of the 20th century, of China's refusal to entirely capitulate to the boot of Western colonialists. Taking on whatever European, American, or Japanese fighter the outsiders bring in to demoralize the natives, Huo becomes a legend that, in real life, is still revered. Thrillingly directed by Ronny Yu (Warriors of Virtue), Jet Li\u2019s Fearless is a dazzling action movie that transcends its breathless fight sequences with Huo's sportsmanship virtues, i.e., knowing when you've won by example, rather than by the fist. Jet Li is superb in the role. --Tom Keogh","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_movies-tv","list_action-movie","list_biographical-movie","list_dramatic-movie","list_movie","list_sports-movie"],"price":2.25,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/M/5/I/M5I-3095103.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/s/f/e/a/fearless-4556334.jpg","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/flixter/m770785041/2e1dc74281fcb91632dcab2067db20e00b2552e0","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0446059/ba41d1397c009737a94eb4e310355bd1df77e6f0","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/7549/08ec11256c8facff11d9110ffef957f43420327a","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/70052464/2ffb0639842cd03947626722e29c9091d1599505"],"years":"2006","stars":4.52678075521751,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_dramatic-movie":"Dramas","list_biographical-movie":"Biographies","list_action-movie":"Action","list_sports-movie":"Sports","list_movie":"Movie"},"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["fb_112430045439081","fb_112798382067161","flixter_m770785041","freebase_0b3sw8","hn_1865183","imdb_tt0446059","moviedb_7549","netflix_70052464","rt_770785041"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Action","Biography","Drama","Sport"],"name":"Fearless","language":"English","title":"Fearless","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_1865183/fearless/","release_date":"2006-09-22","tags":["asian","movie","drama","subtitles","martial arts","action","weapons","asia","biography","biographical","pg-13","action movie","post-1980","strong story","biographical movie","dramatic movie","sports","sports movie","ronny yu"],"birthdate":"2006-01-01","popularity":0,"synopsis":"Martial arts legend Huo Yuanjia became the most famous fighter in all of China at the turn of the 20th Century.

The son of a great fighter who did not wish for his child to follow in his footsteps, the bullied Huo Yuanjia resolves to teach himself how to fight - and win.

When the hood starts contributing better story ideas and dialogue than what the official playwright can conjure, questions (not unlike those of Amadeus) about the price we pay to make art at the expense of other responsibilities are intriguingly raised. Palminteri gives a very interesting performance as the enforcer waking up to the desperate (and almost feminine) demands of his own creative psyche, and Dianne Wiest (who won an Oscar), Tracey Ullman, Jim Broadbent, and Jennifer Tilly are very funny together playing the ensemble cast of Cusack's play. --Tom Keogh","wildcard":false,"topic_ids":["cat_entertainment-media","cat_featured","cat_movies-tv","list_comedic-movie","list_movie"],"price":5.08,"image_urls":["http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/b/b/W/bbW-2976423.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/s/b/u/l/bullets-over-broadway-4530174.jpg","http://aka-img-1.h-img.com/media/img/p/imdb/tt0109348/c7054da2a86aac438d963d1191074f4aa1686311","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/moviedb/11382/ad3f6e5feb63c9b29faa0965fc37f9f51bc92f54","http://aka-img-2.h-img.com/media/img/p/netflix/338944/efcf95febf5e268bc4c4bead9360f9c3927c4fd4"],"years":"1994","stars":4.523071363295395,"affiliate_links":[],"lists":{"list_comedic-movie":"Comedies","list_movie":"Movie"},"popularity":0,"is_personalized":true,"is_saved":false,"is_predicted":true,"aliases":["fb_104274886276877","fb_45290784370","flixter_m13381","freebase_0421ng","hn_1798493","imdb_tt0109348","moviedb_11382","netflix_338944","rt_13381"],"preferences":[],"genres":["Comedy","Crime"],"name":"Bullets Over Broadway","language":"English","title":"Bullets Over Broadway","url":"http://hunch.com/item/hn_1798493/bullets-over-broadway/","release_date":"1995-01-18","tags":["comedy","woody allen","movie","humor","crime","r","blockbuster","crime movie","post-1990","dianne wiest era","mystery movie","thriller-political","funny","comedic movie","funny movie"],"birthdate":"1994-01-01","rt_critics_consensus":"Some of Allen's sharpest, most inspired late-period comedy.","synopsis":"In 1920s New York, a struggling playwright is forced to cast a mobster's talentless girlfriend in his latest drama in order to get it produced.
